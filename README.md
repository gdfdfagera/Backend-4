There are some problems with hosting. I hosted the project and all exepct of admin work. I mean i can login as admin and create a new user, but i cannot go to page adminDelete. And another strange thing is that when I first switch to hosting and log in as an admin, I can go to the adminUpdate page, but if I log out of the admin and log in again, I will no longer be able to go to the adminUpdate page. Everything works correctly on the local server
